- Receive three numbers as input parameters
- Print on stdout if each number is even or odd
- Shouldn't allow less or more than three input parameters. Meaning that if the user provides a number of input parameters different form three a error message should be presented.  


And display this output:

### Second number is "even or odd"
### Third number is "even or odd"
